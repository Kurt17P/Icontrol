Instrument Control (iC) with JAVA
=================================

Instrument Control (iC) â€“ An Open-Source Software to Automate Test Equipment

It has become common practice to automate data acquisition from programmable 
instrumentation, and a range of different software solutions fulfill this task. 
Many routine measurements require sequential processing of certain tasks, for 
instance to adjust the temperature of a sample stage, take a measurement, and 
repeat that cycle for other temperatures. Instrument Control (iC) is an 
open-source Java program that processes a series of text-based commands that 
define the measurement sequence. These commands are in an intuitive format which 
provides great flexibility and allows quick and easy adaptation to various 
measurement needs. For each of these commands, the iC-framework calls a 
corresponding Java method that addresses the specified instrument to perform
the desired task. The functionality of iC can be extended with minimal 
programming effort in Java or Python, and new measurement equipment can be 
addressed by defining new commands in a text file without any programming.

Installation
------------ 

To run the program the Java SE Runtime Environment (version 6.0 or later) must 
be installed. Get the latest version from www.java.com.

Copy the 'iC' directory to your home directory. To find the path to your home
directory, start the program and it will show the path. While copying the iC
directory to your home folder is recommended, it can also reside in the same
directory as the Icontrol.jar file.

In general it should be enough to double click the Icontrol.jar.

If not, try the command java -jar Icontrol.jar from the command line. The
command line is also helpful to see error messages that might appear.
