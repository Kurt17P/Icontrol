Change Log - Instrument Control (iC) with JAVA
==============================================

KPP dedicates this work in devotion to Bhagavan Sri Sathya Sai Baba.
http://java.net/projects/icontrol

16020
User JD contributed some code to YokogawaDL9000 scope. While these changes
were thoroughly tested by JD, I could not test them in the distributed version.

This will likely be the last update I (KPP) make to iC. I can no longer work
myself with iC, and it would need a remake of the GUI in Netbeans Platform
because Netbeans stopped supporting the Swing framework.

I hope iC was and is still usefull for you. Thanks for your support and 
all the best!

IcontrolTest.WaitForUser allows to interrupt JUnit tests and interact with the rest
of the program to e.g. inspect XY_Charts

130303
added a resource folder for JUnit tests
started with SRS_DS345.setARBtoCELIV2


121116
YokogawaDL9000 did not save the time correctly; the fix needs to be tested
first commit from ZHAW


120827
added iC_instrument.getFreeMemory


120818
tweaked the Unit Tests
added LevenbergMarquardt copyright notice

120817
Agilent4155.configSweep set the step value even for Log sweeps
started to rename Agilent package
changed GUI_InterfaceMockup to be not from JFrame
added YokogawaDL9000.setTimeBase + Tests

120815
merged with JUnit test branch
YokogawaDL9000.Start now resets the Extended Event Register so that saveWaveform 
   works after automated Start with aquisition set to Normal (no averaging)

120814
fixed Lakeshore332.setHeaterRange

120810
made Python Prompt window focusable so that text can be copied
added Device.getFileName
added YokogawaDL9000.setTimeBase

120808

started to add YokogawaDL9000.getParameter

120806
fixed exiting in Lakeshore340.setTempCalibrate when user pressed stop

120731
change Lakeshore340.setTempCalibrate to allow calibrating multiple Instruments 
not only two.
Keithley2600.SweepVMeasureI now saved the Detail graph as png

120730
added LakeshreTC.getTempSU (SensorUnits)

120725
introduced Device.m_TerminationCharacters after it occurred that Lakeshore332 does
not execute the RANGE 3 command any more w/o \r\n appended (maybe it's because
an updated NI 488.2 version, who knows)
renamed LM 500 LCLM to Cryomagnetics LM 500 (for MAKE command)
re-implemented LakeshoreXX.setHeaterRange to also act on Loop2
removed LakeshoreTC.enableHeaterOutput

changed TerminationCharacters to be assigned for all classes where iC.properties 
contains a key 'ClassName'.TerminationCharacters


120724
LakeshoreTC.setTemp always queried Kelvin reading of channel A to wait for temperature

120723
iC_ChartXY: use setStandardTickUnits(...) to show very large or very small numbers with
proper tick marks and labels; use setAutoRangeMinimumSize() to allow auto ranging
to very small numbers

voltage slop values
updated Measure CELIV.iC and Setup CELIV.iC in the Example Scripts

120707
Agilent4155.configSMUconstant used %f instead of %E, hence compliance values 
smaller than 1e-6 translated to 0, which also set the measurement range to 10 pA
which significantly slowed down the measurements
LM-500: measuring the liquid cryogen level works
Ensured that the thread is started in iC_Instrument.MonitorChart

120706
fixed bug with getting the proper Y2 axis in iC_Chart
Started with Cryomagnetics LM 500; needs testing

120703
UserFunction is now defined in Agilent4155 not as generic command and it allows
to delete a user function as well

120626
Yokogawa DL9000.SaveWaveform now checks if the waveforms to save are "valid", i.e.
they are not remains of a previous measurement. Also added a test in C++ to check
if  :Waveform:Record minimum? returns NaN if the scope has not triggered (it does not)

120621
Agilent E4980A now measures and saves data in the selected circuit mode
implemented  configCircuitMode, and AC amplitude + Averaging is saved in sweepFthenV
iC_Instrument.WaitForDate parsed different then promised in the ToolTips

120608
Templating the DefaultListModel is not supported by Java JDE 1.6, but in 1.7, so
I remove it again
deleted CleanUpCode branch

120607
added Type to the DefaultListModel in IcontrolView
added Keithley2600.configVoltageSourceRange
modified Utilities.GenerateValues to exclude identical values in log sweep
iC_ChartXY.AddXYDataPoint threw an Exception when a negative value was added to log axis

120601
worked on Keithley2600.EvaluateOPV: Rseries & Rshunt should now be estimated correctly
EurothermTC: checkLoopback is called from setModbusAdr (not before)

120530
Keithley2600.EvaluateOPV changed GaussNewtonOptimizer to LevenbergMarquardtOptimizer
as the former stalls without notice in some circumstances
tried to fix Utilities.GenerateValues (it stopped at 0.699 not at 0.7)

120524 (published as v 1.3.444)
merged branch clean Up Code into trunk
had to increase EOT-WaitTime in EurothermTC and add it to Device.QueryViaRS232

Keithley7001 now waits a bit after opening/closing the switches
fixed Utilities.GenerateValues which did not work when Start>Stop
MeasureOPV now evaluates Rshunt, Rseries using straight line fits

120522
AgilentE4980 displays a status message when an invalid measurement is taken
changed version number from 1.2 to 1.3
iC_Utilities.GenerateValues missed the last data point due to numerical inaccuracies
set Loess Bandwidth to 0.01 for Wei's data

120521
updated Apache Commons Math from 2.2 to 3.0
implemented most of Keithley2600.EvaluateOPV (using the overkill solution of

updated and cleaned up Agilent4155 and EurothermTC

120504
moved some methods from Device to Utilities class
moved Instruments into icontrol.drivers.instruments.ZYX

120502
started changing genericGPIBinstruments to genericInstruments
Ekspla PG122 works with 38400 baud
Branched out Clean-Up-Code:
fixed registering Device classes in a subdirectory of instrument package (from NB)
finished with genericInstruments (GPIB and RS232)


120501
Ekspla works except for setting wavelength (cannot talk to OPO)
started with Keithley Switch
tested current version with Agilent4155 and Eurotherm

120430
added EksplaNT340.NullmodemTest() => RS232 communication appears to work after 
new character encoding is used.
jna.encoding is not set in IcontrolView.myInit

120427
started to universally use ISO-8859-1 character encoding
DS345.setARBtoCELIV works

120426 
Solved (supposedly) the mystery of converting String to byte[]: UTF-8 does not
behave as I thought, ISO-8895-1 does. Need to set that iC-wide
can send arbitray waveforms to SRS DS345

120424
fixed YokogawaDL9000.Savewaveform
compared saved data by iC with saved data from oscilloscope (difference < 6uV)

120423
YokogawaDL9000.SaveWaveform saves and plots multiple channels (averaging does not work)
started with SRS DS345

120420
Can receive Waveforms from the DL9240
TMCTL_Driver is done so far.

120419
changed invokeGenericScriptMethod to also send via RS232 & TMCTL
can talk to Yokogawa DL9240
TMCTL_Driver.Receive works (for arbitrarily long answers)

120417
added "Close TMCTL" to Device.CloseController
renamed Devce.Send/Query to SendCommand/QueryCommand

120416
contd' with TMCTL - it is ready for testing with a DL9000 osci
Device.QueryViaGPIB did not query when a IOtech GPIB controller was used

120414
contd' with TMCTL
moved Agilet4155 into a new package (see if this makes sense)

120413
started with tmctl.dll (ic does not compile)

iC_Properties.getPath now includes the file separator at the end
Agilent4155.PlotData now autoscales without including 0
Agilent4155.PlotData should plot Y1 and Y2 axis; test and rename to PlotData
    tested and renamed

120321
renamed Agilent4155 configDisplayAxis to DisplayAxis and debugged it
debugged Agilent.configSweep
added Agilent4155.configSMUconstant and configVMUconstant

120319
replace kenai.com with java.net & update screen casts
Tried to copy RxTx libraries into lib directory and add lib dir to java.library.path, but
the RxTx libs were not found. It's not nice but easiest to let them remain in the root dir.
I noticed that when started from the command line, the user directory needs to
be the dir where Icontrol.jar resides. Finding the dir where Icontrol.jar resides
is cumbersome (considering that it might be started from Netbeans)

120309
added various methods to Keithley2600

120305
changed Agilent4155.configDisplayAxis - untested

120203
merged IOtech branch into trunk

120124
debugged with the IOtech attached on Paul's computer
fixed Regex for parsing Generic GPIB Instruments
changed RS232_Driver.TimeOut from 100 to 250ms (for the IOtech to work properly)

120122
renamed dir Generic GPIB Instruments to Generic Instruments
added local javadoc

120119

120109
ListTransferHandler is not a private class of IcontrolView, deleted iC_Logger
more clean-up for the paper

120105
GPIB_IOtech should roughly work now. getStatusByte and CloseController are missing

120102
implemented IOtech.Send and checkCommunicationError

111216
found that library .jar files are copied twice to dist folder: once inside the
Icontrol.jar (because the library jar files were stored under the src directory)
and once in the lib directory (Project Directory/Build/Packaging/Copy Dependent 
Libraries). These jars need to be in lib, so the files were moved to the _misc folder

Updated from JFreeChart 1.0.13 to 1.0.14


111215
EurothermTC: fixed WriteA32bitValue, setRampRate

checkLoopBack is now called (all untested yet)

111210
cont' working on IOtech RS232-GPIB controller

111205
found the bug in CRC calculation of Eurotherm (needs further cleanup)
branched out Icontrol_IOtechBranch
started implementing support for IOtech Micro488 RS232-GPIB controller

111130 revision 348
merged Jython branch into trunk
now storing the path to the iC directory (Startup.py was not found)

111129
corrected Regex in Tokenizer which stripped off the / of a path instead of comments
implemented INCLUDE zyx.py

111128
Python integration should be more or less done (including javadoc)

111126
added Device.iSPaused and changed code in the Instruments that used isPaused, adapted javadoc
added is_paused to Startup.py
checked how to use return values in Python

111123
Jython appears to work
single and multiple Python commands can now be sent

111107
Lakeshore340.UpdateCalibrationData: choosing no interpolation curve should work

111104
updated Apache Commons Math from 2.1 to 2.2
allow to choose between Loess and Linear Interpolation for Temperature 
    calibration (work in progress)
debugged LakeshoreTC.autoSetPoint

111103
Serial Number for Input Curves (Lakeshore 340) is now MonthDate
the last script loaded/saved last is now loaded automatically when iC.Debug=1
added Lakeshore340.readCalibrationPoints
now displaying 10000 data points max (manual GC might work)


111102
added manual garbage collection after displaying 500 data points in the hope to
prevent further out-of-memory crashes
worked on some minor ToDo's and bugfixes in setTempCalibrate
changed default log level in debug mode from ALL to FINER
iControlView.getFileName(String) now adds a counter if the file exists

111027
yesterday an OutOfMemory crashed iC.
in GPIB_NI in CloseController the ByteBuffer is released and GarbageCollection started
added Lakeshore340.setTempCalibrate

111026
debugged iC_ChartXY.AddXYDataPoint(ID, X[], Y[]): did not update correctly and did not show last data point
continued improving Lakeshore340.addCalibrationData and .UpdateSensorCurve
implemented LakeshoreTC.SetTemp with better wait for temperature
ChangeLog is now in a separate file
added (almost empty) skeleton for a HP3561 Dynamic Signal Analyzer

111020
continued improving Lakeshore340.addCalibrationData and .UpdateSensorCurve
iC_Instrument.WaitForUser is now modeless

111019
added LakeshoreTC.autoSetPoint and iC_ChartXY.ClearSeries

started with making iC_Instrument.WaitForUser a non-modal (modeless) Dialog

111012
added iC_Instrument.WaitDate

110921
added WaitForUser in iC_Instruments
changed LakeshoreTC.Epsilon from 0.1 to 0.5 (sometimes the temperature change was 
so high that the epsilon was too small

110919
Apparently the set point temperature is not changed when the command is sent
directly after changing the ramp rate on a Lakeshore 332. No error was generated. 
This was confirmed by sending RAMP 2,0,10.000\n\rSETP 2, 70 using NI Measurement
and Automation Explorer. Adding a 100ms delay after setting the ramp rate helped. 
Also added a 100 ms delay in other methods in LakeshoreTC.

110916
sub-scripts that do not include a full path are now searched first in the Project directory,
then in the default iC directory
sub-scripts can now also contain MAKE commands
changed Test_Scripts (in _misc) to Development_Scripts and Example_Scripts

110914
fixed GUI bug (clear table and end editing when a different instrument/command is selected)

110806
added Agilent4155: disable a SMU (not yet tested)

110727
Agilent4155.configDisplayAxis did not set Y2 axis (but Y1 axis instead)

110722
the last Project Directory is now remembered
branched out a RS232branch on the SVN repository
cleaned up the main repository (I hope)

110721
added configDisplayAxis() to 4155
branched out a MCCdaq branch
deleted MCCdaq stuff from this trunk version

110720
added logX/logY option to 4155.PlotData
removed auto cal on and display:window:state 1 from 4155.Close to not change the
display when sequencing done. was unnecessary anyways


110708 
fixed Agilent4155.configSweep (error setting VAR2 number of points)
added JFreeChart-1.0.x.jar which should prevent the queing of events that cuases
the unresponsivness of iC. Select this jar in the project properties instead
of JFreeChart-1.0.13.jar

110707
fixed Agilent4155.SaveData (data was not saved with the proper file name)
Agilent4155 can now plot XY charts of data

110705
add lin/log scaling to Popup menu of iC_ChartXY
HP4192 now selects log scaling of frequency axis when log frequency sweep was selected

110609
make max number of data points shown in a Chart an iC_Property (to prevent a bug)

110606 (1.0.259)
Agilent4155 made SaveData() public
minor bug fix with escaped () in parsing generic GPIB command definitions

Release version is 1.0.258, date 110523
