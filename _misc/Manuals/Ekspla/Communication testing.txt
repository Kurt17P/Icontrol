Communication testing

Because the communication is text string based, it is easy to test remote connection and commands by help of any terminal program. 

Windows users may use hyperterminal. Go Start->Accessories->Communications->HyperTerminal.

Hyperterminal is not very user friendly application. You may use OC CONSOLE intend: http://elmicro.com/files/occonsole_v30.zip

The simplest way to test the connection is to enter command [SAY] in terminal window.

Sender and receiver names may be omitted for a single device connection, so you may enter [SAY] instead of[PL:SAY\PC]. The device will reply with [MS:READY\XX]. XX is the device name.


The data exchange parameters must be set in the following way:
baud rate: 19200 (38400 for some older models PG4XX, PG501)
data bits: 8
parity: None
stop bits: 1
flow control: None
