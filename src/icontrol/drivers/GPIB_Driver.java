     * Upon testing the speed with a Prologix GPIB-USB controller on WinXP (rack
     * computer, Lakeshore 340) it was found necessary to set a minimal USB
     * TimeOut value of 35 ms. While 50 ms worked very often, long time tests
     * indicated that 50 ms might be too short, hence, 75 ms is recommended. The
     * maximum total turn-around time was 47 ms (for 35 ms delay), 63 ms (for
     * 50 ms delay) and 79 ms (for 75 ms delay).<p>
     * In the initial tests only a very low number of test cases were considered.
     * See also iC_Test_Protocol.txt.<p>
     *
     * Using a National Instruments GPIB-USB-HS on a Mac resulted in average
     * turn around times of 16 ms (maximum 26 ms) for a SRS DS345.<p>
