     * To make use of the mechanism that checks the Instrument's response to a
     * *IDN? query to check if the Instrument is of the correct type, add an
     * appropriate entry to the file iC.properties found in the icontrol.resources
     * directory. The entry should consist of this class's name followed by
     * '.InstrumentNameIdentifier' (without quotes). When this nomenclature is
     * used, the default implementation of
     * <code>Device.getInstrumentNameIdentifier</code> checks if the value
     * to this key is contained in the Instrument's response to an *IDN? query.
     * Only if this String is found the Instrument is accepted, otherwise the User
     * is warned. The User can then decide whether or not to accept the Instrument
     * and also if this selection should be persistently stored in the User
     * properties. If the InstrumentNameIdentifier String is empty no *IDN?
     * query is performed. This is important for older Instruments that do not
     * implement the *IDN? command.
     * This whole mechanism is helpful if, as an example, a Lakeshore 334
     * temperature controller is used with a "driver" for a Lakeshore 340
     * temperature controller. The two command sets might be similar but because
     * they are not necessarily identical, it is the User's responsibility to accept
     * a different Instrument than the driver was designed for, and that only
     * supported Device Commands are used.
