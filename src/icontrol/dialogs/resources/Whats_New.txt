- The National Instruments GPIB driver on _Windows_ machines now uses 
  NI4882.dll instead of gpib-32.dll. This allows to run Instrument Control (iC)
  on 64-bit and 32-bit Windows version, but requires NI-488.2 version 3.1 
  or later. To use the old NI GPIB driver, add GPIB_NI.Use64BitDriver=0 to 
  <user home>/iC/iC_User.properties. On Mac/Linux it might be necessary to 
  specifically use the 32-bit drivers, I could not test this.

- added ScriptsInColour (developed by Brian Remedios, many thanks!)
  Loading of Scripts can take a bit longer, you can disable this feature by
  adding iC.RenderScriptsInColor = 0 to iC_User.properties
- changed the JDK version from 1.5 to 1.7 (this should only influence developers)

- The CELIV measurements should now work.

- Lakeshore Temperature Controllers: enableHeaterOutput was removed and 
  setHeaterRange now also acts on Loop2. The Termination characters \r\n
  (defined in iC.properties) are now appended to each message to the instrument.

- The Python scripts have been modified. To access the iC-Framework from your
  modules you need to import iC.py module. Please modify your Python scripts if
  necessary.

- A description of Instrument Control (iC) has been published by the Journal of
  Research of NIST: : http://dx.doi.org/10.6028/jres.117.010 .

- changed character encoding used by iC and JNA from the default encoding,
  respectively, from UTF-8 to ISO-8859-1

- Agilent4155: Parameters for PlotData have changed as it can plot two
  Data Variables now. Please adapt your script accordingly.

120305
- Agilent 4155: configDisplayAxis was changed. Please adapt your iC-scripts that 
  use this command.

- When sending data via RS232, a wait time has been introduced to ensure that,  
  at least theoretically, the data was sent before the program proceeds. This 
  seemed useful to ensure the data was received before a successive command 
  tries to obtain an answer from this instrument.
