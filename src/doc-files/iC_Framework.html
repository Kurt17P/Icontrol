<h2>How the iC-Framework works</h2>
This document outlines in rough sketches how the iC-Framework works. This
document is intended for developers that like to understand the
iC-Framework. For developers that only like to write new Instrument
Classes, the document 'How to write a new Instrument-Class' is better&nbsp;suited.<br>
<h3><a name="Naming_Conventions"></a>Naming
Conventions</h3>
These naming conventions are helpful to clarify and better understand
the comments in the source-code and some variable names. They are not
particularly interesting for somebody who is not reading source code.<br>
<br>


<dl>
<dt>Script</dt><dd>A text that contains the
list of 'Command Lines'.</dd><dt>Sub-Script</dt><dd>Scripts can include other
scripts, so called 'Sub-Scripts'. These
Sub-Scripts can include 'MAKE' commands, but the Instruments defined
there are not shown in the Instrument-List. Nevertheless they can be
used when Command Lines are entered manually.
Future implementations might improve this behavior.</dd><dt>Script-Command, or Command Line</dt><dd>A String which represents
one line of a Script. It consists of either<br>
    <ul><li>a Framework-Command (e.g. MAKE, INCLUDE) followed by an Argument-List</li><li>an Instrument-Name separated followed by a Device-Command and an Argument-List</li></ul>A
space character separates the Framework-Command from it's
Argument-List, and also the Device-Command from it's Arguments-List.
The entries in the Argument-List are separated by semicolons (;). To
use semicolons or double-quotes as characters (as opposed to
separators) escape them (\; or \"). <br>
</dd><dd><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Examples:</span><br>
    <ul><li>
MAKE Tsample Lakeshore 340; GPIB 17</li><li>
MAKE PA Agilent 4155; GPIB 19</li><li>INCLUDE dT.init</li><li>Tsample SetTemp 200; true<br>
      </li><li>PA Measure 0; Vg, Ig, Vd, Id, Is; .trans; ""<br>
      </li></ul>
  </dd><dt>Framework-Command<br>
  </dt><dd>The first word in a Script-Command if the Script-Command does not address an Instrument. It can either be&nbsp;'MAKE'
or 'INCLUDE'. A complete list of available Framework-Commands can be found in the javadoc of the <code>Dispatcher</code> class.</dd><dt>Instrument-Name</dt><dd>The Instrument-Name is the
variable name used to access an
Instrument from a script, for instance 'Tsample' or 'PA' in the above
examples.
It is assigned using the MAKE Framework-Command, and must
not contain spaces.
It is the first word in a Script-Command that addresses an Instrument. <br>
  </dd><dt>Device-Command, or
Instrument-Command, or Script-Command<br>
</dt><dd>The second word in a Script-Command when the
Script-Command&nbsp;addresses an Instrument. For instance 'SetTemp', or
'Measure' in the above
examples. These Device-Commands are processed by the 'Instrument
Class'. All available Device-Commands are (or at least should be)
listed in the javadoc of the implementing Instrument-Classes. </dd><dt>Scripting</dt><dd>Processing (or executing)
the script is called 'scripting'.</dd><dt>Instrument, or Device</dt><dd>An 'Instrument' or 'Device'
is a piece of measurement equipment,
for instance a Lakeshore 340 Temperature controller or an Agilent 4155
Semiconductor Parameter Analyzer.</dd><dt>Instrument-Class, Device-Class,&nbsp;or 'Driver-Class'<br>
</dt><dd>Implements the
functionality of an Instrument - it is so to speak the device driver.
In the code sometimes Instrument-Class is used to refer to the fully
qualified name of the Instrument-Class, for instance <code>icontrol.instruments.Lakeshore332</code>.<br>
</dd><dt>Script-Method, Instrument-Method, or Java method (used in the publication)<br>
</dt><dd>A 'Script-Method' is a Java method in a 'Driver-Class' that implements the functionality of an 'Instrument Command'</dd><dt>Instrument-Class-Name</dt><dd>The name of an Instrument-Class that is presented to the user in
the GUI in the MAKE section. The Instrument is
addressed in a 'MAKE' command using the 'Instrument-Class-Name'. It is
set in <code>RegisterDeviceClasses</code>
to, for instance, 'Lakeshore
340' or 'Agilent 4155' (note the space).</dd><dt>Instrument-Instance</dt><dd>The actual instance (object) of the Instrument-Class addressing the Instrument with the Instrument-Name.<br>
  </dd><dt>Communication protocol/port</dt><dd>Describes how the program
communicates with the Instruments. At
present, it can either be 'GPIB' or 'none'. Later implementations might
also support, say, USB or Ethernet communication.</dd><dt>Communication Driver</dt><dd>A Java class encapsulating methods to communicate with the
Instruments. It interfaces with the platform specific code to access
the GPIB controller.<br>
  </dd><dt>MAKE an instrument</dt><dd>To 'MAKE an Instrument'
means to instantiate the Instrument's
class and open the communication channel if any.</dd><dt>Used Instruments</dt><dd>A list of all instances of
'Instrument-Classes' that are used in
the script. Instruments 'made' in Sub-Scripts are not shown. Later
implementation might change this behavior.</dd><dt>Registered Instruments</dt><dd>A list of all available
'Instrument-Classes' that have been
registered in <code>RegisterDeviceClasses</code>.</dd><dt>Instrument-List</dt><dd>A list of all
'Instrument-Names'.</dd><dt>Device-Command-List</dt><dd>A list of
'Instrument-Commands' of the instrument currently
selected in the <code>JList</code>
that displays the 'Instrument-List'.</dd><dt>No-Communication Mode</dt><dd>When 'No-Communication Mode'
is enabled, no commands are sent or
received from the I/O port. This means that the 'simulated' responses
of the Instruments most often differ from real responses. This mode is
thought to be useful to debug (parts) of the program without the need
to have real Instruments attached. When this mode is used, some care
has to be taken in methods processing the 'Instrument-Commands', and
sometimes it can be beneficial for a method to return a defined answer
when this mode is enabled (for instance the&nbsp;<code>WaitUntilReady</code>
method in
the <code>Agilent4155</code>
class always returns true, simulating
that the
Instrument is ready to receive a command). <br>
</dd><dt>Syntax-Check Mode</dt><dd>When the user starts
processing the Script, the Script is first
processed in Syntax-Check Mode, which tries to ensure that all Script
Commands can be interpreted by the iC-Framework, respectively, the
Instrument-Classes. Methods that support Syntax-Check Mode must return
without any IO Communication and without performing any task when in
Syntax-Check Mode. Once the Script is successfully processed in
Syntax-Check Mode, it is processed again, this time in 'real' mode, so
methods perform their intended task. The Syntax-Check Mode can be
useful to prevent typos which is especially important for long,
unattended&nbsp;measurements. <br>
</dd><dt>Native Code<br>
  </dt><dd>Operating System specific code used for the GPIB drivers; for instance gpib-32.dll (Windows), ftd2xx.dylib (Mac).</dd>

  </ul>

</ul>

    <li>If no Instrument was addressed (the Instrument Name was not found in <code>m_UsedInstruments</code>) a <code>ScriptException</code> is thrown.<br>
    </li>

  </ul>
</ul>
<h3>Device's <code>DispatchCommand</code> method:</h3>



<ul>
  
  <li>Split the Command Line into Tokens, and do lot's of error checking.</li>
  <li>[Remark]: It is advantageous to pass the Command Line (and split
the Command Line twice) to enable processing of Command Lines from
within other Instrument objects.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Identify the object corresponding to the Instrument Name (<code>DeviceInstance</code>).</li>
  <li>Find the method implemented in <code>DeviceInstance</code> which handles the Device Command by using <code>Device.findScriptMethod</code> which returns a ScriptMethod (see below).</li><li>Convert the parameters to pass.</li>
  <li>If the method to invoke (<code>met</code>) checks the Syntax (bares an <code>@iC_Annotation(MethodChecksSyntax=true)</code>
annotation, the method is also invoked during Syntax-Check mode. If the
method does not perform a Syntax-Check, then the method is only invoked
during the 'real run'. Note that during Syntax-Check mode no actions
are to be performed by <code>CallThisMethod</code>, but only the integrity of the passed arguments is to be checked.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Any error should be handled in the invoked method (<code>CallThisMethod</code>) if&nbsp; possible. If an error cannot be handled there, a <code>ScriptException</code> should be thrown which will be presented to the User (in <code>Dispatcher.run</code>), after which Scripting is stopped.<br>
  </li>
  <li>The invoked method might return immediately, or after a short
while. It can also start a new Thread to process the Device Command (see details below).</li>
  

</ul><h3>The <code>ScriptMethod</code> class:</h3><ul><li>An object of this class collects all data associated with an Instrument-Method.</li><li>It is used in <code>Device.DispatchCommand</code> to identify the method to be invoked and also in the Auto-GUI mechanism to access information about a method.</li><li>It contains information about:</li><ul><li>the
method itself (Device-Command-Name, a reference to the method returned
from the Reflection mechanism to invoke a programmatically defined
Instrument-Method, if the method was defined as generic GPIB method,
and the Parameter Types of the method's arguments)</li><li>the GPIB String for generically defined methods</li><li>all info about the Auto-GUI (Parameter-Names, default values, and&nbsp;Tool Tip texts) which is defined either in the&nbsp;<code>@AutoGUIAnnotation</code> for programmatic Instrument-Mehtods or in the {} and ()-fields of a generically defined method.</li><li>all
info about the Syntax-Check (if a Syntax-Check is performed by this
method and the&nbsp;min/max values) which is defined either in the <code>@AutoGUIAnnotation</code> for programmatic
Instrument-Mehtods or in the []-field of a generically defined
method.</li></ul><li>It contains a method that parses the text file containing the definitions of generic GPIB Instruments.</li></ul>
<h3>All Command Lines have been processed:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>The following steps are executed after <code>Dispatcher.run</code> has finished processing the script:<br>
</li>
  <li>Call <code>StopScripting</code> to store a flag (<code>m_StopScripting</code>) in the <code>Dispatcher</code> class and also in the <code>Device</code> class.</li>

  <li>Call <code>Device.Close</code> for all used Instruments<code></code>. This method can be overridden if some extra clean-up work needs to be done.</li>
  <li>Call <code>Device.CloseInstrument </code>for all used Instruments, which closes the communication bridge to the Instrument.</li>
  <li>Call <code>Device.CloseController </code>for one Instrument,&nbsp; which releases the Communication Interface (the GPIB controller).</li>

  <li>Release all Instrument's instances and start Garbage Collection (just for fun).</li>
  

  <li>Call <code>DoneScripting</code> in the View class, which does the following:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Prepare the GUI for a new start</li>
    <li>Show elapsed time and more</li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<h3>A method that handles a Device Command:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>See also <a href="programmatic.html">How to write a new Instrument Class</a>.
  </li>
  <li>If the method performes a Syntax-Check it checks the integrity of
the passed arguments and must return without any further action. If
Syntax-Check fails, it throws a <code>DataFormatException</code> which gets re-thrown as a <code>ScriptException</code> and presented to the User.</li>
  <li>In
No-Communication Mode, the method should return a valid, but obviously
wrong (unphysical) result. This makes debugging the program easier. See the remark
on global/local No-Communication mode in <a href="../../../../icontrol%7Esubversion/Icontrol/src/doc-files/iC_newInstrumentClasses.html">How to write a new Instrument Class</a>.<br>
</li>
  <li>Depending on the chosen communication protocol (defined in <code>Device.m_UsedCommPort</code>)
the String which is to be sent to the Instrument is built and then
sent, respectively, the answer of the Instrument is queried and used to
perform some useful task. [Remark]: To prevent unintended behavior on non-english
environments (where the decimal point might not be '.' but ',') it is
recommended to use the <code>Locale.US</code>, for instance like <code>String.format(Locale.US, ...</code> .</li>
  <li>The return value (must be a assignable to <code>Object</code>) is thus far only used from methods implementing a Device Command
to query an other instruments (for instance <code>Agilent4155.Measure</code> invokes a Command Line to query&nbsp; the actual temperature from a different Instrument,
and this temperature is appended to the file name used to store Agilent's
measurements). <br>
  </li>

  <li>If a method takes longer to finish, it is advisable to check if scripting has been paused (by calling <code>isPaused(true)</code>) or if scripting has been stopped (by polling <code>m_StopScripting</code>).</li>
  <li>Methods can start a new Thread but this Thread needs to terminate itself when scripting has been stopped (by polling <code>m_StopScripting</code>) and it should also observe if scripting has been paused (by calling <code>isPaused(true)</code>).</li>

</ul>
<h3>Generic Instruments</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Upon starting Instrument Control, <code>Dispatcher.RegisterDeviceClasses</code> calls <code>Device.loadGenericInstrument</code>, which <br>
  </li>
  <ul>
    <li>Stores all generic Instruments in <code>Device.GenericInstrument m_GenericInstruments</code></li>
    <li>Adds all generically defined commands as <code>ScriptMethod</code> in this new generic Instrument</li>
    <li>Registers all generic Instruments that have not yet been
registered, that is, every Instrument-Class-Name that is not yet
included in <code>Dispatcher.m_RegisteredInstruments</code> is added to the list with <code>GenericGPIB</code> or <code>GenericRS232</code>
as Instrument-Class depending on the File Extension of the file
containing the generic commands (e.g. .GPIBinstrument.txt or&nbsp;
.RS232instrument.txt)</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Device.DispatchCommand ... to be continued<br>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3><code>m_Logger</code> member variable:</h3>


<ul>
<li>Most classes define a member variable <code>m_Logger</code> to log important messages to a file in the default log-directory specified in the <code>iC.properties</code> (the default path is <code>$userhome$/iC/iC log/</code>).</li>
  <li>To log messages that are important for debugging - in contrast to routine logging - the Logger level <code>fine</code> is used. Only for very basic debugging lower levels <code>finer</code> and <code>finest</code> are used.<br>
</li>
  <li>The Logger level can be chosen from <code>iC.properties</code>.</li>
  <li>There is a Logger <code>m_Comm_Logger</code> with name 'Comm' that logs all communication traffic via GPIB, RS232, TMCTL, ... .<br>
</li>
  <li>Every <code>ScriptException</code> is logged by the <code>Dispatcher</code>, every other <code>Exception</code> should be logged manually if desired.<br>
  </li>

</ul>


<h3><a name="iC_Properties_class:"></a><code>iC_Properties</code> class:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>This class simplifies access to application wide resources (for
instance the iC Logo), and also to access Instrument specific properties that usually do
not need to be changed, but where it can be advantageous that they <span style="font-style: italic;">can be
changed without having to recompile the program</span>. Examples are to change
the default Logger level for GPIB traffic, the default path
used to log GPIB traffic, and the String used in <code>getInstrumentNameIdentifier</code> for most Instruments.</li>
  <li>The properties are divided in two parts, the Default properties and the User properties.<br>
  </li>

  <li>The Default properties are defined in the file <code>iC.properties</code> which is loaded in the static initialization block of the <code>iC_Properties</code> class and stored in a <code>Properties</code> structure.</li>
  <li>The User properties inherit the Default properties, and additionally try to load a file <code>iC_User.properties</code> from the default iC-Directory defined in the <code>iC.properties</code> (usually <code>$userhome$/iC</code>).</li>
  <li>Whenever a key/value pair is changed by the User, the User properties are stored in the afore mentioned file.</li>
  <li>Access to the system wide properties is gained by instantiating the <code>iC_Properties</code> class. Most classes already define such an instance (<code>m_iC_Properties</code>). Instantiating <code>iC_Properties</code> again should not come with
any significant disadvantages.&nbsp; <br>
  </li>

  <li>Note: It appears necessary to perform a Clean&amp;Build in Netbeans after changing <code>iC.properties</code>. <br>
</li>
  <li>Note: The debug mode (iC.Debug) can be enabled when the
program is started from within Netbeans by adding the command line
parameter "iC.Debug 1" (without quotes) in the project settings
(Run/Arguments). When started from the command line, the debug is is
disabled per default. Note that once the debug mode is enabled, the
User
properties are also updated and the debug mode is enalbed also when
started from the command line; to disable this delete the file <code>iC_User.properties</code>.</li>


</ul>
<h3><code>Utilities</code> class</h3>
<ul>
  <li>This class contains some useful utility methos used throughout the program</li>
  <li>Some frequently used methods are <code>static</code>, and to access others, a <code>Utility</code> object needs to be instantiated first.</li>
  <li>To access the <code>static</code> methods, use the fully qualified name (<code>icontrol.Utilities.getInteger</code>) or use <code>import static icontrol.Utilities.getInteger</code> or <code>icontrol.Utilities.*</code> to use <code>static</code> methods without having to type the fully qualified name.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<br>

<h3><code>icontrol.dialogs</code> package:</h3>


This package contains a few classes that encapsulate interaction with the User via modal <code>JDialog</code>s. See the javadoc for the individual classes for details.<br>
<h3><code><a name="Exception_handling"></a>Exception</code> handling:</h3>
At least in theory all possible <code>Exceptions</code> are handled by the iC-Framework. There are three main&nbsp;<code>Exceptions</code>:<br><ul><li><code>ScriptException</code>s are thrown by&nbsp; methods in Instrument-Classes when something unexpected happened. The text of these&nbsp;<code>ScriptException</code>s is show to the User in <code>Dispatcher.run</code> and processing of the script stops. <br>This is&nbsp;at least true in most cases. At the time of writing, one&nbsp;exception to this rule is&nbsp;in <code>iC_Instrument.MonitorChart</code>
which is viewed as a non-critical Instrument-Method, hence, an error
that occurs during displaying a chart should not stop the measurements
and is only presented to the User in the Status Text.</li><li><code>IOException</code>s
are thrown when a communication error occures. When they are thrown by
a method from an Instrument-Class (Instrument-Method),&nbsp;they are at
first caught in <code>Device.SendToInstrument</code> and <code>Device.QueryInstrument</code> and re-thrown. Then, they are re-thrown as <code>ScriptException</code> in <code>Device.DispatchCommand</code> and finally they are presented to the User in <code>Dispatcher.run</code>. Such errors invariaby stop scripting. <br>Future releases of iC might present an option to the user or try to repeat sending/receiving a second time.<br>If an <code>IOException</code> is thrown from <code>Dispatcher.HandleMakeCommand</code> it is handled directly in <code>Dispatcher.run</code>.</li><li><code>DataFormatException</code>s are thrown by Instrument-Methods when the Syntax-Check fails. They are re-thrown as <code>ScriptExceptions</code> in <code>Device.DispatchCommand</code> and presented to the User in&nbsp; <code>Dispatcher.run</code>.</li></ul>The text of all <code>ScriptException</code>s is logged in <code>m_Logger</code>, hence, there is <span style="font-style: italic;">in general</span> no need for Instrument-Methods to log errors when they <code>throw</code> one of the above <code>Exceptions</code> because they are always logged when they are caught in <code>Dispatcher.run</code>.
Exceptions to this rule of thumb could be when new code is developed and no errors are expected to occur once it works. In such
cases the Logger level FINEST is recommended.<br>
<h3>Python Integration<br>
</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The first time a Python command is called (<code>Device.ecexPython</code>), a new <code>PythonInterpreter</code> object is created and also a <code>JythonPrompt</code> window is shown.</li>
  <li>To show the Python window from the GUI, a Python command is sent.</li>
  <li>Each time the user presses Start (and a Python Interpreter has
been created in a previous run) a new Python Interpreter is
instantiated to ensure that Python's namespace is empty.</li>
  <li>After the Syntax-Check is performed, the Python Interpreter is
also reset to ensure an empty namespace (no variables are defined).</li>
  <li>Each time a new Python Interpreter is created, a file <code>iC/Startup.py</code> is executed that provides convenience mehtods to communicate with iC.</li>
  <li>iC exports an instance of <code>Device</code> to Python as <code>_device</code>. Python's path is also set to include the Project directroy and the iC directory.<br>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Some important data structures</h3>
<h4>in class <code>IcontrolView</code></h4>
<ul>
  <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <code>private HashMap&lt;String, String&gt; m_ScriptInstruments</code></li>
  <ul>
    <li>Contains Instrument-Name / Instrument-Class-Name pairs of all Instruments used in the Script.</li>
    <li>Example: PA / Agilent 4155, Tsample / Lakeshore 340, srs / SRS DS 345<br>
</li>
    <li>It is populated in <code>ScriptAddLine</code>, and entries are deleted in <code>jScriptListKeyReleased</code>.</li>
    <li>It is used in <code>jInstrumentNameSelected</code> to identify the Instrument-Class respectively the generic GPIB Instrument.</li>

  </ul>
</ul>
<h4>in class <code>Dispatcher</code></h4>
<ul>
  <li><code>private HashMap&lt;String, String&gt; m_RegisteredInstruments</code></li>
  <ul>
    <li>Contains Instrument-Class-Name / Instrument-Class pairs of all
available Instruments. Every new Device-class needs to be registered
here to be accessible from the script.<br>
    </li>
    <li>Example: Lakeshore 332 / icontrol.instruments.Lakeshore332, SRS DS345 / icontrol.instruments.iC_GenericGPIB<br>
</li>
    <li> The Instrument-Class-Name is used to populate the ComboBox that allows to add MAKE commands. It is also used in <code>Device.DispatchCommand</code> to identify the instances the Script-Command is passed to, and in <code>IcontrolView.jInstrumentNameSelected</code> to search all available Script-Methods.</li>
    <li>The Instrument-Class is a String that contains the actual class
name of the class that implements the functionality of that Instrument.
Note that it must contain the full class name including package, that
is "icontrol.Lakeshore340" not only "Lakeshore340". Generic GPIB
Instruments register as class <code>iC_GenericGPIB</code>.</li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><code>private HashMap&lt;String, Device&gt; m_UsedInstruments</code></li>
  <ul>
    <li>Instrument-Name / Instrument-Instance pairs of the Instruments
used in the script.<br>
</li>
    <li>Example: Tsample / the instance of <code>Lakeshore340</code> for this Instrument, srs / the instance of <code>iC_GenericGPIB</code> with the Instrument-Name set to srs<br>
</li>
    <li>It is populated in <code>HandleMakeCommand</code>.<br>
    </li>
    <li>Class <code>Device</code> is passed a "reference" to this list from the constructor.</li>
  </ul>
  </ul>
<h3>in class <code>Device</code></h3>
<ul>
  <li><code>protected static HashMap&lt;String, Device&gt; m_UsedInstruments</code></li>
  <ul>
    <li>A "refernce" to <code>Dispatcher.m_UsedInstruments</code>.</li>
  </ul>
  <li><code>protected static HashMap&lt;String, GenericGPIBInstrument&gt; m_GenericGPIBInstruments</code><br>
  </li>
