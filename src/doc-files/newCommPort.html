<h2>How to implement support for a new Communication Port<br>
</h2>
This document describes step-by-step how to implement a new
Communication Port such as USB or Ethernet. This document uses the implementation of the RS232 port as an example.<br>
Support for
communication ports usually requires calling native code. Calling native code can
either be done using JNA, or sometimes a JAVA package is available that
handles calling the native code already. For the discussed example of
implementing support for the RS232, the <a href="http://rxtx.qbang.org/wiki/index.php/Main_Page" target="_blank">RxTx package</a>
is used, which consists of native code (e.g. rxtxSerial.dll,
librxtxSerial.jnilib, and more) and also a .jar file (e.g.
RXTXcomm.jar).
<h2>If a .jar file is available to call native code<br>
</h2>
<h3>Preparations<br>
</h3>

<ul>

</ul>

<ol>
  <li>If no .jar file to call native code is available, the
communication with native code will have to be implemented using JNA in
the Driver class as discussed below.If a .jar file to call native code is available: <br>
  </li>
  <ul>
    <li>Copy the .jar file into a new folder inside the Icontrol/src folder<code></code></li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li>Include the new .jar file in the project properties (Libraries)</li>
  </ul>

  
  <li>Copy the native code into _misc/libraries</li>
  <li>Modify build.xml so that Ant copies the native code files into
the distribution directory. This should ensure that they are available
when Instrument Control is executed without having to install support
for the new communication port manualy. The Ant command to copy is:<br>
    <code>&lt;copy file="_misc/libraries/rxtxSerial.dll todir="${dist.dir}" /&gt;</code></li>
</ol>
<h3>Modify Instrument Control</h3>
<ol>
  <li>It is advisable to consult the routines used to implement GPIB support (in class <code>GPIB_NI</code>) when writing new code as discussed in the following.<br>
</li>
  <li>Add the new port to <code>public enum CommPorts {GPIB, RS232, none}</code> in class <code>Device</code></li>

  <li>Modify <code>IcontrolView.ScriptAddMake</code> to define the string used in the MAKE script-command</li>
  <li>Add <code>else if</code> branch in <code>Dispatcher.HandleMakeCommand </code>to remember the chosen communication port. This method also calls <code>Device.OpenInstrument</code>.<br>
</li>
  <li>Modify <code>Device.OpenInstrument</code> to call the specialized Open method for the new communication port, e.g. <code>OpenRS232</code>. <br>
</li>
  <li>Implement the specialized 'OpenPort' method, for instance <code>OpenRS232</code>. Essentially, these steps are necessary:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Add a member variable that holds a handle to the new driver class.</li>
    <li>Instantiate a new driver.<br>
    </li>
    <li>Call the method in the driver class (<code>RS232_Driver.OpenPort</code>)
that opens the communication port. Note that not all communication
ports need to be opened (for instance GPIB does not require that, but
requires to open a dedicated instrument instead).</li>
    <li>If instruments attached to the new communication port need to be opened, call this open method (see <code>Device.OpenGPIB</code>).</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Update <code>Device.CloseInstrument</code> as required (for RS232 this closes the COM port because there is only one instrument per serial port).</li>
  <li>Update <code>Device.CloseController</code> as required (for RS232 no change is required).</li>
  <li>Implement <code>Device.SendViaZYX</code> (for instance <code>Device.SendViaRS232</code>). See <code>Device.SendViaGPIB</code> for an example.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Implement <code>Device.QueryViaZYX</code> (for instance <code>Device.QueryViaRS232</code>). See <code>Device.QueryViaGPIB</code> for an example.</li>


</ol>
<h3>The new Driver class</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Create a new class for the new communication port, e.g. <code>RS232_Driver</code></li>
  <li>Define member variables for a new Logger and <code>iC_Properties</code>.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Implement a constructor that:</li>
  <ol>
    <li>Initialize the logger and iC_Properties (see <code>GPIB_NI</code>)</li>
    <li>If JNA is used to call native code, the native library should be loaded.<br>
    </li>
    
  </ol>
  <li>Implement a method that opens the connection to the port if
necessary. Remark: For GPIB no "port" needs to be opened, while for
serial communication, the RS232 needs to be opened.</li>
  <li>Implement a method that opens the connection to a specific
instrument if necessary (for GPIB this is necessary, for RS232 it's
not).</li>
  <li>Implement <code>Send(String Message)</code></li>
  <li>Implement <code>String Receive()</code></li>
  <li><br>
  </li>



</ol>
<h3>A new Instrument Class using the new communication port</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Make a new instrument class derived from Device<br>
</li>
  <li>Add a <code>@iC_Annotation(CommPorts, InstrumentClassName)</code> to the class</li>

  <li>in <code>Device.OpenInstrument</code> add case new interface</li>
  <li>in <code>Device</code> implement specialized <code>Open</code> method for new interface (e.g. <code>OpenRS232</code>)</li>
  <li>more?<br>
</li>
</ol>

<br>
<h2>Write a class to support the new Comm Port</h2>
When no Java package is available which supports the new communication
port, a new class is required which typically uses JNA to call native code. The
example described here is to implement support for the RS232
communication port.<br>
<h3>Preparations<br>
</h3><br>
<ol>
  <li>Copy the native code into _misc/libraries</li>
<li>Modify build.xml so that Ant copies the native code files into
the distribution directory. This should ensure that they are available
when Instrument Control is executed without having to install support
for the new communication port manualy. The Ant command to copy is:<br>
    <code>&lt;copy file="_misc/libraries/rxtxSerial.dll todir="${dist.dir}" /&gt;</code></li>
</ol>
<h3>Modify Instrument Control</h3>
Additionally to the above modifications to Instrument Control, the following modifications are necessary.<br>
<ol>
  <li>Create a new class in the instrument package (e.g. <code>RS232_Driver</code>)</li>
  <li>Define a Logger (see e.g. <code>RS232_Driver</code>)</li>
  <li>in the new driver class implement the <code>Open</code> method</li>
  <li>implement
a constructor that loads the native library and brings the controller
to a status that enables opening the instrument by calling Open (follow
the example of <code>GPIB_NI</code>)<br>
  </li>
</ol>



<h2>Adding support for generic Instruments using the new Comm Port</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Add a new <code>GenericZYX</code> class, where ZYX is the short name for the new Communication Port (e.g. <code>GenericGPIB</code>, <code>GenericRS232</code>. This class' main task is to define a<code> @iC_Annotation(CommPorts=CommPorts.ZYX)</code> annotation.
It may, additionally, overwrite some methods that are called in Device
classes that support the new communicaiton port but should not be
called for generic Instruments. See <code>GenericGPIB.getInstrumentNameIdentifier</code> for an example.</li>
  <li>Update <code>Device.loadGenericInstrument</code> so that generic Instruments are registered with the proper class just created in the previous step.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Update <code>Dispatcher.RegisterDeviceClasses</code> so that the new file extension is recognized<br>
  </li>
</ol>
