<h2>How to write a new Instrument-Class and extend existing ones<br>
</h2>
An Instrument-Class, or Driver-Class, implements all commands related
to an Instrument.
It is so to speak the driver for that Instrument. This tutorial
presents step-by-step instructions to implement new commands in Java. <br>
Note that it is also possible to use the Python integration to create new functionality as explained <a href="doc-files/adPython.html" target="_blank">here</a>.<br>

<h3>Write a new Instrument-Class</h3>

The easiest way to a new Driver-Class is by using the template <code>NewInstrument.java</code>
in the package <code>icontrol.instruments</code>:<br>

<ul>

</ul>

<ol>

  <li>Duplicate <code>NewInstrument.java</code> and rename <br>
  </li>
  <ul>
    <li>the file <br>
    </li>
    <li>the class, and <br>
    </li>
    <li>the name of the Logger</li>
  </ul>
  <ol>
    <ul>
      <li>Note that the Logger level is automatically set to inherit
the level of the parent
Logger in the constructor of the <code>Device</code> class.</li>
    </ul>
  </ol>
  <ul>
    <li>Note that all Instrument-Classes need to be a descendent from class <code>Device</code><code></code>.</li>
    <li>Note: Netbeans 7 can get confused by manually renaming a class
file. If iC does not compile after this step, quite Netbeans and delete
the cache directory userdir\.netbeans\[version]\var\cache\<br>
    </li>

  </ul>
  <li>Update the <code>iC_Annotation</code> at the declaration of the
class&nbsp;</li>
  <ul>
    <li>to declare which communication protocolls are supported, and <br>
    </li>
    <li>to define the name used to access Instruments of this kind from
the Script-Commands.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Update the javadoc section at the beginning of the class</li>
  <ul>
    <li>with your name and <br>
    </li>
    <li>a description of the Instrument.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Add you Instrument's response to a '*IDN?' query to the file <code>iC.properties</code><br>
  </li>
  <ul>
    <li>What is this good for?&nbsp;</li>
    <ul>
      <li>If an Instrument returns an unexpected ressponse to a *IDN?
query , the User is presented a <code>WrongIDN</code> dialog with some
options on how to proceed further.</li><li>The IDN check is performed for GPIB communication only.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Add a line <code>YourClassName.InstrumentNameIdentifier = abc</code>
where <code>abc</code>&nbsp; is the response of your Instrument to a
*IDN? query</li>
    <li><code>abc</code> should only contain that part of the response
that identifies
the <span style="font-style: italic;">family</span> of Instrument, not
an individual Instrument, hence it is
recommended to strip the serial number returned by many Instruments.</li>
    <li>To find <code>abc</code> start a script that MAKEs your new
Instrument with <code>abc</code> being an empty String. iC will show
you the response. <br>
    </li>
    <li>If your Instrument does not support IEEE 488.2 or you do not
want iC to perform a IDN-check you don't have to add this line, or you
can leave <code>abc</code> blank.</li>
    <li>For more details consult the description in <code>Device.getInstrumentNameIdentifier</code>.</li>
  </ul><li>Need special Termination characters</li><ul><li>Most
instruments I have encoutered so far do not require to send special
characters to signal an end of transmission. If your instrument does
require special characters to be sent to signal the end of
transmission, add a line <code>YourClassName.TerminationCharacters = abc</code>
where <code>abc</code>&nbsp;
are the characters that will be appended at every message to the
instrument (e.g. \r\n for Lakeshore332 temperature controllers)</li></ul>
</ol>

This is it! <br>

Your new Instrument-Class should be accessible from Instrument-Control.
Start iC and check if you can MAKE a new Instrument with the class you
just created. Note that the methods that were implemented in <code>NewInstrument.java</code>
are already available as script-commands. <br>

<h3>General remarks about methods implementing script-commands</h3>

<ol>

</ol>

<ol>

  <li> Methods that should be able to be called from a script
(Device-Commands) must be <code>public</code> to be visible for the
Reflection mechanism.</li>
  <li>If these commands should also be shown in the GUI's Command-List
they must bare an <code>@AutoGUIAnnotation</code> annotation.</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Note that commands can be used as script-command even if no <code>@AutoGUIAnnotation</code>
is provided<br>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <li>Such methods can only use the supported data types, which are: <br>
  </li>
  <ul>
    <li><code>int</code></li>
    <li><code>float</code></li>
    <li><code>double</code></li>
    <li><code>boolean</code></li>
    <li><code>String</code> </li>
  </ul>
  <li> Add every Device Command to the 'Device Commands:' section of
the class' javadoc.</li>
  <ul>
    <li>This is the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">very
important for other users</span> because this is (at the time of
writing) the only way to know which device-commands are available
without having to look at the source code.</li>
    <li>Please use the template in <code>NewInstrument.java</code>.</li>
  </ul>
</ol>

<h3><a name="Syntax-check_mode"></a>Syntax-check mode</h3>

<ul>

  <li>It is advisable to implement a Syntax-Check for every
method. <br>
  </li>
  <li>Methods that implement a Syntax-Check are called by the
    <code>Dispatcher</code> during Syntax-Check Mode and they <span style="text-decoration: underline;">must</span> return after the
Syntax-Check
    <span style="text-decoration: underline;">without</span> any
IO-Communication becasue IO-Communication has not been initialized at
that point. They also should not perform any other operations. </li>
  <li>An
example can be found in <code>NewInstrument.ReferenceImplementation</code>.
  </li>
  <li>The Syntax-Check should always be performed before checking the
No-Communication Mode.</li>
</ul>

<h3>No-Communication mode</h3>

<ul>

  <li>Use <code>Device.inNoCommunicationMode</code> to query the
status of No-Communication Mode.</li>
  <li> When in No-Communication-Mode, methods might want to return a
value that is similar to a real answer but clearly distinguishable from
a real answer (for instance return a temperature of -1.1 Kelvin). <br>
  </li>
  <ul>
    <li>This allows other parts of the program to be tested while the
user can clearly identify when this mode is accidentally enabled. </li>
  </ul>
  <li>Per default, read and write operations (<code>SendViaGPIB</code>
or <code>QueryViaGPIB</code>) simply return without any IO operations,
hence, they return an empty response that might me unexpected. <br>
  </li>
  <li>There
is a global No-Communication switch which enables No-Communication Mode
for
all Instruments, and a local No-Communication switch which enables this
mode for individual Instruments. <br>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Error handling in Java methods</h3>

Whenever an error occurs in a method one of the following three <code>Exceptions</code> should be thrown:<br>
<ul>
  <li>A new <code>ScriptException</code>
should be thrown for general errors.</li>
  <ul>
    <li>These Exceptions are automatically presented to the user and will, in general, bring processing of the script to a halt. See <a href="iC_Framework.html#Exception_handling">these</a> additional comments.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>A new <code>DataFormatException</code> should be thrown when the Syntax-check was not successful. See also <a href="#Syntax-check_mode">this</a>.</li>
  <li>A new <code>IOException</code> should be thrown when IO communication failed. Such <code>Exceptions</code> are usually only thrown by the iC-Framework, and need only be declared possible.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
Also consider this:<br>
<ul>
  <li>The Exceptions should contain a String describing in detail the
cause of the error, the consequences, and if available, a suggested
cure.</li>
  <li>The text of these exception will be presented to the
user by the iC-Framework and execution of the script is , in general, stopped. </li>
  <li>This
text, is automatically logged to <code>m_Logger</code> by the
iC-Framework.</li>
  <li>More details can be found <a href="iC_Framework.html#Exception_handling">here</a>.<br>
  </li>
</ul>

  
<ul>

  
  
</ul>

<ol>

</ol>

<h3>Lengthy Java methods - Stop &amp; Pause signal<br>
</h3>

Methods that do not return instantaneously (for instance because
they wait for a certain temperature to be reached) should periodically
check <br>

<ul>

  <li>if Scripting has been stopped (by checking <code>m_StopScripting</code>)
and</li>
  <li>if Scripting has been paused (by calling <code>isPaused(true)</code>)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Concurrent Java methods</h3>

<ul>

  
  <li>Methods can start new Threads, but the Thread needs to terminate
itself when Scripting is stopped (by checking <code>m_StopScripting</code>). <br>
  </li>
  <li>Processing the thread should also be interrupted when Scripting is
paused (by calling <code>isPaused(true)</code>).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Additional Initializations</h3>
<ul>

  
  <li>If a class needs extra initialization after IO communication
was established implement a method&nbsp; <code>Open()</code>.</li>
  <li>The default
implementation of <code>Device.Open</code>&nbsp;clears
the Instrument's interface (*CLS) and performs an IDN-check, therefore, if the
new Instrument supports IEEE 488.2 function calls, it is recommended to
invoke the base class'&nbsp;<code>Open</code>&nbsp;method. <br>
  </li>
  <li>Note that
the&nbsp;<code>Open</code>&nbsp;method
is only called during the 'real' run and not while in Syntax-check mode
and not when in No-Communication mode.</li>
  <li>See <code>Device.Open</code> for more details.</li>
  <li>See <code>HP4192.Open</code> and <code>Agilent4155.Open</code> for examples.</li>
  <li>See also <a href="#Older_Instruments_not_suporting_488.2">these</a> remarks.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="Older_Instruments_not_suporting_488.2"></a>Older Instruments not suporting 488.2</h3>
<ol>

  
</ol>
<ul>
  <li>If the new Instrument does not support IEEE 488.2 function calls,
in particular the *CLS and *IDN? commands, it is necessary to override the <code>Open</code><span style="font-family: monospace;"> </span>method to avoid communication
errors. <br>
  </li>
  <li>An example can be found in the <code>HP4192</code> class.</li>
</ul>
<ol>

  
</ol>
<h3>Additional Clean-up</h3>
<ul>
  <li>If a class needs extra clean-up after the Script has been
processed (before the instance of the Instrument is garbage collected)
implement the <code>Close</code> method.</li>
  <li><code>Close</code> is called by the iC-Framework for every
Instrument instance (<code>m_UsedInstruments</code>) after processing
of the Script. <br>
  </li>
  <li>An example can be found in <code>Lakeshore340.Close</code>.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<ol>

  
</ol>
<h3>Processing Script-Commands in Java methods</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Methods can easily processs Script-Commands (also during Syntax-Check mode) and use the returned <code>Object</code>
for further processing.</li>
  <li>The recommended procedure to process a Script-Command is to  create a temporary object of class <code>Device</code> and
invoke it's <code>DispatchCommand</code>
method.</li>
  <li>For an example see<code></code> <code>NewInstrument.ReferenceImplementation</code> or <code>Agilent4155.Measure</code>.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Some Tips</h3>
<ol>

  <li>To make sure all <code>Exceptions</code> are handled properly and are also
described properly in the javadoc, comment the <code>throws</code>
line for the method
and check Netbeans' error messages that appear as the little icons or
when building the javadoc.</li>
  <li>So far it was never necessary, but some&nbsp;new methods might need to be <code>synchronized</code>
or
variables might need to be declared <code>volatile</code> when the
same object will be /
can be accessed from multiple threads.<br>
  </li>
</ol>
